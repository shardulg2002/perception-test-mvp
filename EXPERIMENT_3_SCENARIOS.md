# Experiment 3: Illusion of Control - 5 Scenarios

## Overview
Experiment 3 tests driver's perception of control and attribution in different driving situations. Each scenario presents a unique driving hazard with two modes (Manual vs Driver-Assist) and multiple possible actions.

## Scenario Structure
Each scenario follows this flow:
1. **Scenario Selection** (2s display)
2. **Mode Choice** - Choose between Manual Control or Driver-Assist
3. **Intervention Phase** - 2-second reaction window with keyboard controls
4. **Outcome Display** - Shows result (Safe-Pass, Near-Miss, or Crash)
5. **Attribution Question** - Type A, B, or C based on scenario

## Keyboard Controls
- **Arrow Keys**: ↑ Accelerate, ↓ Brake, ← Left, → Right
- **WASD Keys**: W Accelerate, S Brake, A Left, D Right
- **No Action**: Let system/physics handle it

## Scenario 1: High-Speed Highway Merge
**Attribution Type:** A (Assign Responsibility)

### Context
Driving at 70 mph on a highway when a vehicle from the on-ramp merges aggressively into your lane.

### Outcomes

#### Manual Mode
- **No Action**: Collision occurs (Crash) - Attribution: Self
- **Brake**: Slow down just in time (Near-Miss) - Attribution: Self
- **Accelerate**: Speed past hazard safely (Near-Miss) - Attribution: Self
- **Left/Right**: Swerve to adjacent lane (Near-Miss) - Attribution: Self

#### Driver-Assist Mode
- **No Action**: System handles with hard braking (Near-Miss) - Attribution: Other Driver
- **Brake**: System conflict causes scrape (Crash) - Attribution: System Conflict
- **Accelerate**: System overrides, sudden stop (Near-Miss) - Attribution: Driver-Assist
- **Left/Right**: Lane-keeping conflict, loud horn (Near-Miss) - Attribution: Self/Driver-Assist Conflict

### Attribution Question
"Who or what was most responsible for the outcome?"
- Your driving decisions
- The Driver-Assist system
- The other driver's actions
- Road conditions

## Scenario 2: Residential Street Sharp Curve
**Attribution Type:** B (Choose Consequence)

### Context
Driving through a residential area at 25 mph when you see a child's ball rolling into the street around a blind curve.

### Outcomes

#### Manual Mode
- **No Action**: Natural slow speed allows safe pass (Safe-Pass) - Attribution: Self/Environment
- **Brake**: Smooth effective stop (Safe-Pass) - Attribution: Self
- **Accelerate**: Rush curve, hit ball (Near-Miss) - Attribution: Self
- **Left/Right**: Smoothly steer around (Safe-Pass) - Attribution: Self

#### Driver-Assist Mode
- **No Action**: System reduces speed automatically (Safe-Pass) - Attribution: Driver-Assist
- **Brake**: Combined optimal stopping (Safe-Pass) - Attribution: Self/Driver-Assist
- **Accelerate**: System override delayed, clip ball (Near-Miss) - Attribution: Self/Driver-Assist Conflict
- **Left/Right**: System assists smooth adjustment (Safe-Pass) - Attribution: Driver-Assist

### Attribution Question
"If this scenario happened again, which of these outcomes would you prefer?"
- Safe Pass with no intervention
- Near-Miss with quick reaction
- Safe Pass with system assistance
- Avoiding the situation entirely

## Scenario 3: Rainy Overpass Pothole
**Attribution Type:** C (Future Behaviour)

### Context
Driving over an overpass during heavy rain. Water pooling obscures a large pothole ahead.

### Outcomes

#### Manual Mode
- **No Action**: Hit pothole dead-on, hard jolt (Near-Miss) - Attribution: Environment
- **Brake**: Too late, loud thud (Near-Miss) - Attribution: Environment
- **Accelerate**: Too late, loud thud (Near-Miss) - Attribution: Environment
- **Left/Right**: Swerve to edge, minor bump (Safe-Pass) - Attribution: Self

#### Driver-Assist Mode
- **No Action**: System can't detect, direct hit (Near-Miss) - Attribution: Environment
- **Brake**: Combined braking too late (Near-Miss) - Attribution: Environment
- **Accelerate**: System prevents increase, can't avoid (Near-Miss) - Attribution: Environment
- **Left/Right**: Manual override successful, edge hit (Safe-Pass) - Attribution: Self

### Attribution Question
"In the future, how would you approach similar situations?"
- Trust the system more
- Take manual control
- Slow down preemptively
- Rely on experience

## Scenario 4: Red Light System Error
**Attribution Type:** A (Assign Responsibility)

### Context
Approaching a traffic light that turns red. Your Driver-Assist system has a known issue with over-braking at red lights.

### Outcomes

#### Manual Mode
- **No Action**: Natural smooth stop (Safe-Pass) - Attribution: Self
- **Brake**: Controlled comfortable stop (Safe-Pass) - Attribution: Self
- **Accelerate**: Attempt to beat light, hard brake (Near-Miss) - Attribution: Self
- **Left/Right**: Position while slowing (Safe-Pass) - Attribution: Self

#### Driver-Assist Mode
- **No Action**: System over-brakes, uncomfortable stop (Safe-Pass) - Attribution: Driver-Assist
- **Brake**: Combined over-braking, very sudden (Safe-Pass) - Attribution: Driver-Assist
- **Accelerate**: System overrides, awkward lurch (Safe-Pass) - Attribution: Driver-Assist/Self Conflict
- **Left/Right**: Lane-keeping with hard stop (Safe-Pass) - Attribution: Driver-Assist

### Attribution Question
"Who or what was most responsible for the outcome?"
- Your driving decisions
- The Driver-Assist system
- Traffic light timing
- System malfunction

## Scenario 5: Late Lane Merge
**Attribution Type:** B (Choose Consequence)

### Context
Highway construction forces a lane merge. Heavy traffic. You're late and trying to merge aggressively.

### Outcomes

#### Manual Mode
- **No Action**: Miss window, sudden stop (Near-Miss) - Attribution: Other Driver/Self-Inaction
- **Brake**: Brake too early, miss window (Near-Miss) - Attribution: Self
- **Accelerate**: Speed into gap successfully (Safe-Pass) - Attribution: Self (High competence)
- **Left/Right**: Aggressive maneuver works (Safe-Pass) - Attribution: Self (High competence)

#### Driver-Assist Mode
- **No Action**: System too conservative, miss window (Near-Miss) - Attribution: Driver-Assist
- **Brake**: Combined caution, long delay (Near-Miss) - Attribution: Driver-Assist/Self
- **Accelerate**: System resists then allows, delayed success (Safe-Pass) - Attribution: Self/Driver-Assist
- **Left/Right**: System assists with hesitation (Safe-Pass) - Attribution: Driver-Assist

### Attribution Question
"If this scenario happened again, which of these outcomes would you prefer?"
- Safe merge with confidence
- Conservative wait for clear gap
- System-assisted merge
- Avoid aggressive merging
